In this project, we delved into a comprehensive dataset on electric vehicles using SQL queries. 
Our analysis focused on understanding trends, patterns, and insights within the electric vehicle landscape. 
By exploring aspects such as adoption rates, geographic distributions, and electric range variability, we gained valuable insights into the evolving world of electric mobility.

Key Points:

Analyzed EV adoption trends over time.

Explored geographic distribution across regions.

Identified top EV makes based on registrations.

Investigated eligibility rates for CAFV in legislative districts.

Visualized distributions using mapping techniques.

Examined electric range variability among EV models.

Explored the average electric range for each make.

Investigated EV type breakdown (BEV vs. PHEV).

Provided insights for stakeholders in sustainable transportation.

Developed data-driven strategies for informed decision-making.
